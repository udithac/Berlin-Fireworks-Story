# Berlin Fireworks Data Storytelling - New Year 2025 

## 🎉 Wishing You a Year of Discovery, Growth, and Data-Driven Success! 📊✨

## Project Overview
This repository explores how Berlin experienced **5 hours of continuous fireworks celebrations** (8:00 PM till 1:00 AM) on **New Year's Eve 2025**. As a **data scientist**, curiosity sparked an analysis of how such an event could deliver a **seamless, continuous sound effect** for hours. 

## 🔍 Data-Driven Approach
I analyzed Berlin's **demographics** and proposed **two participation scenarios** to explain the observed phenomenon using data-driven storytelling.

## 📊 The Data Behind the Celebration
**Source:** [Wikipedia - Demographics of Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Berlin)  
- **Total Households:** ~2 million  
- **Single-Person Households:** 54%  
- **Families with Children (<18):** 337,000  

---

## 📈 Scenario 1: Smaller Participation Group
- **Focus:** 337,000 families with children under 18, likely to participate.  
- **Assumption:** 50% actively participated → **168,500 families**.

### Key Insights:
- **Continuous sound effect:** Requires **10 families per second** over **5 hours (18,000 seconds)**.
- **Minimum participation required:** Only **11% participation** sustains the effect.

#### Formula:
**180,000/337,000 ~ 11%**

---

## 📉 Scenario 2: Larger Participation Group
- **Focus:** ~2 million households in Berlin.
- **Assumption:** 50% actively participated → **1 million households**.

### Key Insights:
- **Continuous sound effect:** Requires **10 families per second** over **5 hours (18,000 seconds)**.
- **Minimum participation required:** Only **17.5% participation** sustains the effect.

#### Formula:
**180,000/1,000,000 ~ 17.5%**

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaways
- Both scenarios highlight how **distributed participation** creates the **illusion of continuity**.
- **Small, timed actions** lead to an **impactful collective experience**.
- Combining both groups could reduce participation even further while maintaining the effect.
